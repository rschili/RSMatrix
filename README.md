# Narrensicher.Matrix

For now this is just a little hobby project to support the matrix.org chat protocol in .NET.
I tried several libraries and got none of them to work as they were all still in beta or abandoned.

The german word "Narrensicher" means "fool proof" which is what I'm trying to go for.
